# Work I did (and did not do) for DDS

The DDS project started at MSR, led by my supervisor before he joined UoT, and before I started as a PhD student. So I didn't get the opportunity to contribute to the design of this system; I did work on the storage engine (and marginally on the network engine and offload engine) of DDS. Anyway, it was a good first-time learning experience for me, and I enjoyed working with everyone involved.
