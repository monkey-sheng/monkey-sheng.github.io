<!-- This project is meant to help students and researchers across University of Rochester create their
  own hosted academic website for free with GitHub. 

## About this Site

This project is a slight customization based off of some great work by 
  [NC State University Libraries](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/).
  The original project, called [`jekyll academic`](https://ncsu-libraries.github.io/jekyll-academic-docs/)
  has its own [github repository](https://github.com/NCSU-Libraries/jekyll-academic)
  and [workshop documentation](https://ncsu-libraries.github.io/jekyll-academic-docs/workshop/). 


## Creating Your Own

To see a step-by-step guide to build your own site, go to the [RESEARCH](/research) section. 
  There you'll find a basic [guide](/blog/getting-started) that will help you
  create your new site. -->

I'm Jiasheng Hu, currently a 2nd year PhD Student at [Far Data Lab](https://fardatalab.org), supervised by [Prof. Qizhen Zhang](https://qizhenzhang.me). I'm interested broadly in disaggregated data processing systems, especially where networking and storage come into play. I enjoy identifying and solving challenges that arise with resource disaggregation, as well as emerging hardware, for example, SmartNICs or DPUs, which have been the focus of my research work to date -- it is an exciting and rather unexplored platform for databases, that could potentially bring significant performance uplift.

As a junior researcher, I am actively exploring new ideas and research directions, so feel free to reach out and have a discussion with me, whether it's something about databases, or else!
